## 🌟 Example Reminder (Age 4-12)

"It's been a fun day of playing and learning. Let's take a little 'quiet moment' together. Close your eyes for a second and take a deep breath in... and out. It feels good to rest our eyes, doesn't it? If you're thirsty, maybe take a sip of cool water, too. I'll be here if you need me."
